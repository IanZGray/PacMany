# MIT - Pac Man Exercise

## App Information

### Title: Pac Many

### Description

This page showcases two major things: 
1. Buttons that run functions from imported javascript files
2. Having those imported elements interact with the display by having them bounce off the sides. 

The generated pac men move around the screen at different velocities and bounce once they hit the borders. 

### How to Run

Simply download the zip folder with the source code file, or fork it into your github and clone it into your machine, and run it by using your favorite IDE.
